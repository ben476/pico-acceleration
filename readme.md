# Raspberry Pi Pico + BMA456 Accelerometer

No (external) libraries ðŸ˜Ž

Originally for the [CRISiSLab Challenge](https://www.crisislab.org.nz/crisislabchallenge), this is a simple example of how to use the BMA456 accelerometer with the Raspberry Pi Pico. It handles sending the BMA456 a config and reading the data from the sensor.
